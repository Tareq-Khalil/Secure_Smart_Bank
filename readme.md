# Secure_Smart_Bank

### Description
Secure_Smart_Bank is a sustainable, low-energy smart bank prototype built using eco-friendly materials like clay and straw. Designed for off-grid or low-resource regions, the structure incorporates green architecture and smart embedded systems powered by ESP32.

### Why I Made the Project
The rise in energy consumption and environmental impact from modern infrastructure called for a solution that is both technologically advanced and eco-conscious. I developed this project to see how renewable energy, automation, and traditional construction materials can integrate into a sustainable and secure smart building for banking services.
